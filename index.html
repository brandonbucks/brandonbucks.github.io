    <h1>The White House Paper for BrandonBucks</h1>
    <h2>An experimental cryptocurrency for the people by the people</h2>

    <p>tldr; BrandonBucks is a cryptocurrency born from the Let's Go Brandon meme. The token will serve as a hedge against Joe Biden's inflation.</p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>BrandonBucks was inspired by the meme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Go_Brandon">"Let's Go Brandon!"</a></p>

    <h2>Why BrandonBucks?</h2>
    <p>The current primary purpose of BrandonBucks is to serve as a hedge against the inflation Joe Biden has caused and continues to cause here in America.</p>
    <p>The community of 'Brandons' will define the future of the token.</p>
    <p> BrandonBucks is different because it seeks to live past the meme.</p>
    <p>What is a Brandon?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Someone who owns BrandonBucks</li>
      <li>Someone who chants "Let's Go Brandon"</li>
      <li>Someone who loves America</li>
      <li>Someone who is tired of incompetent leaders hurting our country</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By having a purpose behind the coin, we hope that BRBX will become something more than a meme, something worthwhile, a movement if you will.</p>
